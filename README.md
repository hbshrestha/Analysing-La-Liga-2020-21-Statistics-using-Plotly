# Analysing-La-Liga-2020-21-Statistics-using-Plotly
The objective of creating this repository is to analyse the basic statistics of La Liga 2020/21 season. As a fan of FC Barcelona, I am going to analyse using Barcelona as a reference and make the comparison with the top two teams, Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid. 

I am going to use the Plotly package to create interactive plot and a dashboard for this purpose.
